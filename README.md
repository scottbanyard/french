# Basic French Programs in C

I have created two small C programs to recap the French language.

### frenchTranslations.c

This program currently:

- translates numbers 0 to 99,999

- translates months

- translates colours

- quick tests after translations with score system

- updated numbers, months and colours tests : can choose how many questions you want, and it will ask you random, non-duplicated questions each time to be tested on

- updated switchboard : it will now be re-called after doing a certain category and the program can be quit via the switchboard

### Installation

- open up a command line / terminal and _cd_ to a directory
- type in `git clone https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-programs-C`
- run the frenchTranslations.exe file by typing in `/frenchTranslations` or `./frenchTranslations`
- learn some french!


Following this I have created a Java GUI to test users with an easier interface. This can be found at https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-gui-test-java if interested.

### frenchVerbs.c

This program currently:

`- helps practise present tense`

`- helps with irregular verb endings`

`- helps with regular verb endings`
