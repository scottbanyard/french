# Basic French Programs in C

I have created two small C programs to recap the French language.

### Installation

- open up a command line / terminal and **cd** to a directory
- type in `git clone https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-programs-C`
- type in `/frenchTranslations` or `./frenchTranslations` to run the french translation program OR `/frenchVerbs` or `./frenchVerbs` to run the french verbs program
- learn some french!

### frenchTranslations.c

- translates numbers 0 to 99,999
- translates months
- translates colours
- tests : can choose how many questions you want, and it will ask you random, non-duplicated questions each time to be tested on
- switchboard allowing choice of translation options and easy user navigation

Following this I have created a Java GUI to test users with an easier interface. This can be found at https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-gui-test-java if interested.

### frenchVerbs.c

- helps practise present tense
- helps with irregular verb endings
- helps with regular verb endings
