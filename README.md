# Basic French Programs in C

I have created two small C programs to recap the French language. 

### frenchTranslations.c

This program currently:

`- translates numbers 0 to 99,999`

`- translates months`

`- translates colours`

`- quick test after translations with score system`

Following this I have created a Java GUI to test users with an easier interface. This can be found at https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-gui-test-java if interested.

### frenchVerbs.c

This program currently:

`- helps practise present tense`

`- helps with irregular verb endings`

`- helps with regular verb endings`
